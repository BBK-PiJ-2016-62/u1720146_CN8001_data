Summary
Big Data has the potential to transform the ways that analysts understand the world in which we live. Social media data, a subset of big data, could provide a new method of examining society that was hitherto available through snapshot methods such as census data or surveys.
One of the defining features of modern society is the move to mass uptake of social media, the creation, sharing and exchange of information, ideas and pictures within virtual communities and networks. Millions of individuals from across the globe have signed up to social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, and this phenomena has led to vast collections of personal data. As the tools to analyse and organise vast quantities of digital data have been developed, both commercial and governmental organisations have considered how that social media data might be put to use.
We have found the UK well-placed to take advantage of social media data, and its analysis, for the benefits of better governance and commercial opportunities. There are, however, persistent problems in ensuring that the education system is generating people with the right skill sets to feed this growing industry and that government organisations have the necessary insights to ensure it is used to its fullest extent for the benefit of UK citizens.
One key aspect of the use of social media data is the tension that exists between the generation of data by individuals and the use of that data by organisations. We have not been convinced that the users of social media platforms are fully aware of how their data might be used and what redress they may, or may not have if they disagree with how an organisation exploits that data. This is exacerbated by our finding that terms and conditions contracts are simply too long and complex for any reasonable person to make any real sense of. Reading such documents has been likened to engaging with "Shakespeare". Drafted by lawyers, to be used in American court rooms, the contents of terms and conditions have been designed to protect organisations in the event of legal action. As a mechanism for showing that users have provided informed consent, so that organisations can process incredibly personal data, terms and conditions contracts are simply not fit for purpose.
We were pleased to find a willingness among those in the industry to develop good practice and to seek ways in which the users of services might better understand how their data may be used, how to actively protect their privacy and how to judge the ethical standards of service providers. We are keen to see the Government become more actively involved in developing global standards and possibly kitemark that would mark out service providers that meet those global standards in the care and handling of personal data.
We are worried that current legislation is no longer sufficient now that data moves more easily across digital platforms and that technologies can be used to analyse multiple sets of such data in real time. Whilst legislators have reflected on how regulation should be updated, governing bodies are floundering when it comes to the details of legislation. The draft EU General Data Protection Regulation (2012) has attracted criticism from industry, and progress on agreeing a final commitment has not been forthcoming. Furthermore, national governments can find it difficult to regulate industries who provide services that can be delivered from anywhere in the world. Personal data should not be undervalued and the Government has a clear responsibility to explain to the public how personal data is being used to make improvements to products and facilities. The Government needs to lead the conversation around security of personal data, so that in future years, members of the public can engage with online services with the confidence that their personal data is secure.
